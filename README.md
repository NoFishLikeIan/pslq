# PSQL 🦉

A basic implementation of the PSQL algorithm to find integer relations!

## Why?

Planning to use the alogirthm for the classical trascendental/algebraic problem.
In synthesis to find a polynomial, with integer coefficients and root `𝜆`, the idea is to apply PSLQ on the finite set`{ 1, 𝜆, 𝜆2, …, 𝜆𝑛 }`!

## But really... why?

To maybe get an efficient implementation so that I can produce a nice little plot that I can brag about with my friends.

## P.S.

C++ noob here, don't judge please 🙏🏻
